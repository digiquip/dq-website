# Mark work equipment with QR codes

With Kvipp Bedrift, you can mark equipment with QR codes.

## Link equipment and QR codes:

1. Give people who are to link equipment and QR codes the role of "equipment owner". You do this on the "authorities" page.

import velgutstyrseier from '/img/kvipp-docs-equipment/velgutstyrseier.png';

<img src={velgutstyrseier} style={{width:450}} />

2. Go to the website kvipp.it

3. Identify the equipment

4. Go through the wizard and make sure that model and brand are written correctly

5. In the dropdown menu, select "QR codes and identifiers". Select "Scan and link"

6. Place the QR code on the equipment and take a picture of the QR code (from "scan and link")

import knyttQR from '/img/kvipp-docs-equipment/knyttQR.jpg';

<img src={knyttQR} style={{width:450}} />

7. Test that the QR code is linked

**Done!**
