# Get started

We've created Kvipp with the purpose of making it super easy to document equipment-specific training, with no preparation required.

# How to do it

Note that you can start with equipment-specific training via Kvipp at any time. It's not necessary to add people and equipment in advance.

**1. Go to kvipp.it**
[Click here to go to Kvipp](https://kvipp.it)

**2. Identify yourself**
Scan your HSE card (QR code). When you use the HSE card, the information is automatically added to the correct company.
Alternatively, you can use a driving licence or passport, and AI will interpret the information (picture). When you take the picture, make sure you include name and date of birth.

**3. Identify the equipment**
Let artificial intelligence recognise brand and model. For example, take a picture of the serial number plate. Make sure you take the picture so that brand and model are visible. Alternatively, you can scan DigiQuip or M-REG/REGINN QR code.

**4. Check training status**
When both person and equipment are identified, you'll see the training status.

## Training Status

**Training missing.** "Oops! You lack the competence to use this equipment" means that documentation is not registered. You can then either upload previous documentation, complete a self-declaration or find someone who can provide training.

**Training is in place.** "Good to go" tells you that documentation is in place. Now you can also download training certificates and provide training to others.

## Provide training to others
1.Select "give training"
2.Go through the general checklist.
3.Participants are added to the session at the end by scanning the participants' HSE cards or alternatively driving licence or passport.
4.When you have added everyone, select "complete training".

Note! The "give training" option is only available when you have registered training and are "Good to go". If it says "Oops!" you must first document your own training.

## Completed trainings
There are several ways to find completed trainings and training certificates.

- **Training certificates by email**

Go to kvipp.it and identify yourself. Then go to the dropdown menu at the top and add email address. Choose to receive all training certificates by email.

- **Download**

You can also find training status in Kvipp, and from there download training certificates. Identify both person and equipment to get the latest status and document.

- **Kvipp Bedrift subscription**

In Kvipp Bedrift, all training is updated in real time. As a manager, you can easily find out what training your people have, who can use which equipment and not least group equipment and people to keep track of any gaps and progress.

Kvipp Bedrift costs 490 kroner per month for small companies (up to 10 employees) and 1390 kroner per month for others.

- **K-REG (& HMSREG)**

Training data and documents can be uploaded directly to K-REG. The K-REG integration can either be purchased standalone for 990 kr per month or as an add-on to Kvipp Bedrift for 500 kr per month. For small companies, the K-REG integration is included.

PS: You don't need a subscription in K-REG for the information to be uploaded there. All training that is added to K-REG also becomes available in HMSREG. Contact Sentralregisteret for more information about this.

# Tips for getting started

To ensure that everyone documents their training in Kvipp, we recommend communicating the importance of this and making it easy to remember. A couple of tricks that can make it easier to remember are to put up information and make sure the website is saved to the home screen.

## Information
Make sure all employees are aware that training should be documented digitally via [kvipp.it](https://kvipp.it). Also remember that you should have routines and instructions for training. Take it as part of other meetings you have, e.g. status meetings or employee interviews.

## Delegate
We recommend involving people with interest, motivation and competence in the rollout from day one. For example, an engaged supervisor, craftsman or others in the field can bring others on the team to carry out training and establish this as a routine.

## Include training in safety rounds
From time to time, set training as a topic on the safety round and do spot checks. This helps create awareness and you can follow up on any missing training quickly. See more on the "safety round" page.

## Posters
Use posters as reminders. Download from here or contact us for prints.
