# Risk assessment equipment use

Risk assessment is about identifying hazards when using an equipment type, assessing probability and consequence, and implementing measures to reduce risk to an acceptable level. Risk assessment is done at the category level.

Consequence:
Scale from 1 - 5, where 1 is harmless and 5 is very serious. 
1.Harmless: Insignificant personal injuries.
5.Very serious: May result in death. 

Probability:
Scale from 1 - 5, where 1 is unlikely and 5 is very likely. 
1.Unlikely: Less frequent than once per 10 years. 
5.Very likely: More than 10 times per year.

## Precautions during use
In addition to clarifying training requirements, you can define which precautions should be taken when the equipment is used. Go through these precautions during training. In addition, the precautions become visible in Kvipp for the person concerned.

## Risk before and after
When you have defined training requirements and precautions, you make a new assessment of risk. In this way, you get documented assumed risk before and after.

For example: 
Before using a brush saw, safety training must be completed and documented. During use, protective clothing must be used. Protective clothing includes safety boots, safety trousers, helmet with mounted hearing protection and visor/safety glasses. Before use, you should inspect the brush saw (daily check). Use of protective clothing reduces the consequence it will have if the saw comes into contact with the leg.
