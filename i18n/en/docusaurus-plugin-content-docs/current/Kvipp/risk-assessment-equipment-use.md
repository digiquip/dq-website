# Risk assessment equipment use

Risk assessment is about identifying hazards when using an equipment type, assessing probability and consequence, and implementing measures to reduce risk to an acceptable level.

For example: Before using a brush saw, training must be completed and documented.

During use, protective clothing must be used. Protective clothing includes safety boots, safety trousers, helmet with mounted hearing protection and visor/safety glasses. You should wear a signal-colored jacket and carry a single-person pack/first aid kit. Before use, you should inspect the brush saw, be careful to check the blade. We also recommend that you park in such a way that you can get away relatively easily if something should happen.

In practice: Create a category called brush saw, and list the precautions to be taken. Assess whether all types of brush saw are similar or different. Then give training in the use of brush saw.

During the training, you discuss the precautions, and you make these available so that the list can be retrieved on a later occasion.

Tip! Learning points may be wise to add to the list.
