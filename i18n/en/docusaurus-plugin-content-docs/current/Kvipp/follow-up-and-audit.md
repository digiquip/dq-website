# Follow-up and audit

Regular follow-up and annual revision of training requirements and risk assessments ensure safe use of equipment, fewer deviations and better compliance.

## Why annual revision?
- Requirements, equipment and work processes change
- New incidents and experiences should be included in the assessments

## Suggested annual cycle
- Annually: revise training requirements and risk assessments, update categorizations
- When changes occur: revise when you get new equipment, new work operations, new technology
