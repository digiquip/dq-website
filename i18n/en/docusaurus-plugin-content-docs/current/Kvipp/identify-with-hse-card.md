# Identification with HSE card

Instead of logging in, we use HSE cards and other ID (driving licence, passport) for identification. With this, it is **not** necessary to add users or create accounts to use Kvipp.

## HSE card and QR code
When you want to use an HSE card: Use the QR code button and scan the QR code on the HSE card. The system automatically finds name and employer, and in this way the training is automatically linked to both the correct person and company. The system ensures that everything is documented and systematized.

## HSE API access
With access to Arbeidstilsynet's API, we retrieve first name, surname, date of birth and employer.

"The QR code on the card shows the status that is registered in the public registers when the code is scanned." Read more about this here: https://www.arbeidstilsynet.no/hms/hms-kort/

## Other identity cards
Don't have an HSE card? Alternatives to the HSE card are driving licence, passport or possibly Kvipp ID.

When you want to use driving licence and passport: Use the image button and take a picture of the card. You must include first name, surname and date of birth.

## Is it problematic that anyone can scan the HSE card?
No.

It's not the case that anyone should have the opportunity to scan an HSE card. There are clear guidelines about who can scan HSE cards. This is described on Arbeidstilsynet's website, https://www.arbeidstilsynet.no/hms/hms-kort/.

It is the employee's responsibility to take care of the HSE card. Among other things, Arbeidstilsynet requires that it must be immediately reported as lost and that the employee can be punished if the HSE card is loaned out.

With these guidelines from Arbeidstilsynet, it is clear that HSE cards must not be misused. This also applies to identification of people in connection with training.

## Is it problematic that we can only scan an ID card?
No.

Everyone who has HSE cards, driving licences and passports has a responsibility to take care of these cards and who gets access. As with, for example, driving licences, it is possible to check others' competence via Kvipp.
