# Groups

Groups let you organize equipment and people for easier follow-up. The purpose of groups is to simplify the work of ensuring that people have the necessary training. Perhaps you want to group by trade, to plan for when you hire new people, or as a temporary project - you can try out groups for this.

In addition, you can print a QR code for the group. When you scan this QR code, you'll see all the equipment in that group. This gives you a shortcut to start training on many equipment at once.

## Examples of groups
- Projects or locations
- Trade groups, e.g., construction, carpenters, etc.
- Equipment types, e.g., all equipment types in shed A

## Use cases
- Gap analysis: Group people and equipment, and see who is missing training
- Prepare: Create a group with equipment and use this QR code as an entry for later training

Note: Groups are not the same as training requirements or categories.
