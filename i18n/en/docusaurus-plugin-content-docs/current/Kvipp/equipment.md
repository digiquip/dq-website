# Work equipment

## How do I get equipment into Kvipp Bedrift?
Equipment is automatically added as training is registered or you can add it manually.

## Identification of machines and equipment

There are three ways to identify equipment:

1.Image recognition: **Artificial intelligence and machine learning** makes it possible to recognise equipment using images. Find a place on the equipment where brand and model appear and take a picture. Artificial intelligence will interpret the image and you get a suggestion for brand and model. Go through the wizard and be careful that brand and model are written correctly.

2.QR code: When you scan QR code from DigiQuip, BRAREG or REGINN, Kvipp finds brand and model.

3.Search and add manually: Kvipp Bedrift customers can **add equipment manually**. With the "equipment owner" role, you can search and add equipment.

## Mark work equipment with QR codes
With Kvipp Bedrift, you can mark equipment with QR codes. With QR codes, you give a nice reminder about equipment-specific training.

**Link equipment and QR codes:**

1.Give people who are to link equipment and QR codes the role "equipment owner".

import velgutstyrseier from '/img/kvipp-docs-equipment/velgutstyrseier.png';

<img src={velgutstyrseier} style={{width:450}} />

2.Go to the website kvipp.it

3.Identify the equipment.

4.Go through the wizard and make sure that model and brand are written correctly

5.In the dropdown menu, you choose "QR codes and identifiers", and then you get the opportunity to link: Choose "Scan and link"

6.Put the QR code on the equipment and take a picture of the QR code (from "scan and link")

import knyttQR from '/img/kvipp-docs-equipment/knyttQR.jpg';

<img src={knyttQR} style={{width:450}} />

7.Test that the QR code is linked

**Done!**
