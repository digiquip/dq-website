# Categorization with AI

Need help with categorization of equipment types? Make use of artificial intelligence!

## How it works
Kvipp sends a request to an AI service with brand and model, and suggests the correct category. The result is shown in Kvipp Bedrift with a justification, so you can confirm or reject the suggestion. We have also added "search" which takes you directly to Google so that you can easily double-check the suggestion.

## How to get the most out of artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence tries to match equipment type to category in this order:

1. Match against the categories you have defined
2. Match against common categories in the system

This means that you will get the most out of artificial intelligence if you first create categories that make sense for you.
