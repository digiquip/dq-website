# Provide training

Provide training in the use of equipment via Kvipp, and save a lot of time!

## What do you need to provide training?
- Work equipment.
- Mobile phone and your own ID.
- Make sure participants can identify themselves (HSE card, driving licence or passport).
- Clarify whether the training certificate should be uploaded to Kompetanseregisteret.

## How to provide training
To provide training, you must first register your own training. Then you'll get the option to "provide training". Follow these steps:

1. Identify yourself and the equipment, and optionally add your own training
2. Select "provide training"
3. Go through a general checklist
4. Add the participants at the end. Participants need an HSE card or driving licence/passport to be added to the session. There is no upper limit to how many participants can be added.
5. Complete! Training is automatically saved!

## What gets documented?
- Training given by
- Training given to
- Date
- Training certificate (PDF)

## Common questions
- **Do I need an account?** No. Identification is done with HSE card, driving licence or passport.
- **Does the equipment need a QR code?** No. You can take a picture and let artificial intelligence recognize brand and model.
- **Is the training of the person providing training checked?** No, there is no specific check of or documentation requirement for the training of the person providing training. The focus is that the recipient should receive necessary training before use of equipment, and that this is documented.

Training should be given by someone who has the competence to provide training, but unlike certified training, it can be given by anyone. For certified training in earth-moving machines, etc., however, the instructor must be certified.

If an accident occurs, can we substantiate that the person received necessary training? This means that you can document that the recipient actually received necessary training before use.
