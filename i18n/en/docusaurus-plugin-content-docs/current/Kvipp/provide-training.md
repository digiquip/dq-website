# Provide training

Provide training in the use of equipment via Kvipp, and save a lot of time! In Kvipp you can conduct and document:
- Equipment-specific training
- Documented safety training

# Equipment-specific training

## What do you need to provide equipment-specific training?
- Work equipment.
- Mobile phone and your own ID.
- Make sure participants can identify themselves (HSE card, driving licence or passport).
- Clarify whether the training certificate should be uploaded to Kompetanseregisteret.

## How to provide equipment-specific training
To provide training, you must first register your own training. Then you'll get the option to "provide training". Follow these steps:

1. Identify yourself and the equipment, and optionally add your own training
2. Select "provide training"
3. Go through a general checklist
4. Add the participants at the end. Participants need an HSE card or driving licence/passport to be added to the session. There is no upper limit to how many participants can be added.
5. Complete! Training is automatically saved!

## What gets documented?
- Training given by
- Training given to
- Date
- Training certificate (PDF)

# Documented safety training
In Kvipp you can provide documented safety training, i.e. mandatory training for various categories such as angle saws, rollers and more. 

NB: Kvipp does not support conducting certified safety training. 

To provide documented safety training, the category must be risk-assessed and you must have the role "instructor, documented safety training". 

- Categorize 
- Risk assess 
- Add at least one piece of equipment (brand and model)

Add the people who are to be instructors. 

## How to provide documented safety training

#### Steps to get started with documented safety training
**Preparation:**
1.Define categories.
2.Risk assess the categories.
3.Assess whether new equipment-specific training is necessary for all brands and models (similarity assessment). You do this as part of the risk assessment. 
4.Add at least one equipment type per category. You start the training from this equipment type.

**Control who can provide documented safety training:** Go to "authorities" and assign the role "Instructor, documented training". Only people with this role can provide documented safety training.

**Conduct:**
Identify yourself and scan a piece of equipment that has been added to the category. 

When you select an equipment type (brand and model) that has been added to a risk-assessed category, you get the option to "provide documented safety training". You can find this option behind the "provide training" button. 

The session is two-part: First you conduct the documented and then equipment-specific. The wizard guides you through this in an easy way. 

Add the participants at the end. 

When the participants are added, two training certificates are generated per participant, one for documented and one for equipment-specific. For example "Angle grinder" and "Bosch EXWS30-180B".

## Common questions
- **Do I need an account to receive training?** No. Identification is done with HSE card, driving licence or passport.
- **Does the equipment need a QR code?** No. You can take a picture and let artificial intelligence recognize brand and model.
- **Is the training of the person providing training checked?** No, there is no specific check of or documentation requirement for the training of the person providing training. The focus is that the recipient should receive necessary training before use of equipment, and that this is documented. 

Training should be given by someone who has the competence to provide training, but unlike certified training, it can be given by anyone. For certified training in earth-moving machines, etc., however, the instructor must be certified.

If an accident occurs, can we substantiate that the person received necessary training? This means that you can document that the recipient actually received necessary training before use.
