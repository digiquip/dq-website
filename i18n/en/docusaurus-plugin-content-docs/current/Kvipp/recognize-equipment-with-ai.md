# Recognize equipment with artificial intelligence

To make it easy in the field, you can identify work equipment using artificial intelligence.

We use several established libraries for artificial intelligence and machine learning so that you can take a picture of equipment and get it recognized. The same applies to driving licences and passports.

Here's how to do it:
1. Go to kvipp.it and select camera
2. Take a picture of the equipment where you capture brand and model

Artificial intelligence will return a suggestion. It is important that you review that brand and model are correct, and edit if necessary.

## There are three ways to identify equipment:

1. Image recognition: **Artificial intelligence** makes it possible to recognize equipment using images. Find a place on the equipment where brand and model appear and take a picture.

2. QR code: When you scan a QR code from DigiQuip, BRAREG or REGINN/Maskinregisteret, Kvipp finds brand and model.

3. Search and add manually: Kvipp subscribers can **add equipment manually**. With the "equipment owner" role, you can search and add equipment.

## Mark work equipment with QR codes
With Kvipp Bedrift, you can mark equipment with QR codes.

**Link equipment and QR codes:**

1. Give people who are to link equipment and QR codes the role of "equipment owner". You do this on the "authorities" page.

import velgutstyrseier from '/img/kvipp-docs-equipment/velgutstyrseier.png';

<img src={velgutstyrseier} style={{width:450}} />

2. Go to the website kvipp.it

3. Identify the equipment

4. Go through the wizard and make sure that model and brand are written correctly

5. In the dropdown menu, select "QR codes and identifiers". Select "Scan and link"

6. Place the QR code on the equipment and take a picture of the QR code (from "scan and link")

import knyttQR from '/img/kvipp-docs-equipment/knyttQR.jpg';

<img src={knyttQR} style={{width:450}} />

7. Test that the QR code is linked

**Done!**
