# Roles

## The "instructor" role

With the instructor role, the person providing training gets more options:
- Can provide training on multiple equipment in the same session.
- Can provide training on behalf of the company. On the training certificate, it will state that training is given on behalf of the company.
- Automatic upload to K-REG (requires activated K-REG integration)
- Overview of completed training.

The role is assigned on the page called authorities.

With the "instructor" role, all training sessions are placed in an overview. The overview includes all people that the instructor has given training to - both internal and external. To retrieve who has received training, you can search by participant name and equipment type. Here you also have the option to send documentation (PDF) directly by email.
