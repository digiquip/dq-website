# Upload to Competence Registry

Kompetanseregisteret is a registry operated by Sentralregisteret for registration of various competencies.

Equipment-specific training can be uploaded directly to K-REG, either as an add-on to Kvipp Bedrift or standalone. K-REG also shares competencies with HMSREG.

✓ Visible in HMSREG via Kompetanseregisteret
✓ No manual data registration required
✓ Ongoing documentation of equipment-specific training

When training is given, all information and documentation (PDF) is transferred to K-REG. Who has received and given training, which equipment (brand and model) and date.

## Automatic transfer of equipment-specific training

When a person with the role of "instructor" provides practical equipment-specific training to any of your employees, the result is automatically uploaded to K-REG. This includes both internal training and training received from rental companies, manufacturers and others who use Kvipp AND have registered instructors.

Self-declarations and training given without the instructor role are NOT uploaded.

### Contact us to activate the integration

Call us at **69 83 85 00** or email **support@digiquip.no** to activate the K-REG integration.

## HMSREG integration

Kompetanseregisteret has an integration with HMSREG. This means that you will also get equipment-specific training visible in HMSREG.

## Do I need to be a subscriber in K-REG?
No. You only need to activate the integration. Training is uploaded to K-REG regardless of whether you are a subscriber.
