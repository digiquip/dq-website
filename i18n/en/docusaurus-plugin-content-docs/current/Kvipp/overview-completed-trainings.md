## How to find completed trainings
As a manager, you can easily get an overview and retrieve documentation. You can do gap analyses and specifically follow up with those who need training.

## Use Kvipp on inspection rounds to check equipment-specific training

When you're taking an inspection round and checking if people have the correct equipment-specific training on the equipment, you can use Kvipp.

Here's how:
**1. Go to the website kvipp.it.
2. Scan the person's HSE card.
3. Scan the equipment, use either the serial number plate or QR code (DigiQuip). Artificial intelligence recognizes brand and model; it's important that this is included in the image.
4. Now you'll see the status! Either the person is "good to go" or training is missing.**

If training is missing, provide training on-site or have the person fill out a self-declaration.
