# Training requirements

With training requirements, you ensure focus on necessary training. This ensures better documentation, and not least less administration.

## Employer's responsibility
- Assess risk and need for training
- Document which equipment are considered similar
- Make requirements and routines known to employees
- Ensure implementation of necessary training

## Training requirements in Kvipp
With training requirements, you get documented which requirements apply to all or specific people. We have created a guide that simplifies this work. The result is one or more documents (PDF) that are made available in Kvipp for those it applies to.

The guide takes you through:
- Who the training requirements apply to
- Which categories are covered
- Assessment of need for equipment-specific training
- Conclusion training requirements

## What is meant by similarity?
If the equipment types in a category are similar, then training is not needed on all types. You assess similarity based on an assessment of, among other things, operation, safety equipment, area of use, functionality, personal protective equipment, and daily inspection. If you can answer yes that the types of equipment are similar, there is no requirement for new equipment-specific training on each piece of equipment.

This assessment and conclusion must be documented to be valid.

## Publishing training requirements
You don't need to think about the actual publication of training requirements. The training requirements are automatically made available to the person it applies to in Kvipp.
