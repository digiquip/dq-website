# Training before use of work equipment

With Kvipp you get everything in one place: Document both safety training and equipment-specific training efficiently.

Safe use of work equipment starts with proper training. For equipment that requires special caution, all employees must have necessary training before use (cf. regulations on work execution chapters 10 and 11).

## What is necessary training?
The training must enable employees to use equipment correctly, understand relevant hazards and know necessary measures.

**Complete documented safety training and equipment-specific training simultaneously. Since documented safety training includes a practical part, it's natural to document training on the specific equipment in the same session.** This is best done in Kvipp!

## Documented safety training
When work equipment can be dangerous, both theoretical and practical training is required. The training is given at the category level, for example personnel lifts, angle grinders or brush saws. See § 10-2 in regulations on work execution for more information, https://www.arbeidstilsynet.no/regelverk/forskrifter/forskrift-om-utforelse-av-arbeid/ 

There are no formal requirements for who provides the training, as long as the person is competent to train others.

## When is certified training required?
Certain categories must be trained by certified companies:
- Bridge and overhead cranes (when there is a risk of injury)
- Tower cranes
- Mobile cranes over 2 tm
- Gantry cranes
- Truck-mounted cranes over 2 tm
- Lift trucks and stackers with permanent driver's seat
- Earth-moving machines over 15 kW (20.4 hp)
- Offshore cranes

For these categories, training must always be given from a certified instructor and company. See § 10-3 in regulations on work execution for more information, https://www.arbeidstilsynet.no/regelverk/forskrifter/forskrift-om-utforelse-av-arbeid/  **Kvipp does not support this functionality.**

## Equipment-specific training
Also called type training or machine-specific training, this is training on the specific machine (brand and model) before use. It must be documented in writing which equipment (brand and model) training has been given on, who has given the training and who has received it. See § 10-4 in regulations on work execution for more information, https://www.arbeidstilsynet.no/regelverk/forskrifter/forskrift-om-utforelse-av-arbeid/ 

## Other types of equipment?
Kvipp can also be used on other types of unique equipment. For example construction elevators, paint rooms and so on. You can easily add this via Kvipp.
