# Training before use of work equipment

Safe use of work equipment starts with proper training. For equipment that requires special caution, all employees must have necessary training before use (cf. regulations on work execution chapters 10 and 11). With Kvipp, you get an efficient solution that ensures documentation and traceability.

## What is necessary training?
The training must enable employees to use equipment correctly, understand relevant hazards and know necessary measures.

**Complete documented safety training and equipment-specific training simultaneously. Since documented safety training includes a practical part, it's natural to document training on the specific equipment you use in this part. This function is coming very soon to Kvipp!**

## Documented safety training
When work equipment can be dangerous, both theoretical and practical training is required. The training is given at the category level, for example personnel lifts, angle grinders or brush saws.

There are no formal requirements for who provides the training, as long as the person is competent to train others.

## When is certified training required?
Certain categories must be trained by certified companies:
- Bridge and overhead cranes (when there is a risk of injury)
- Tower cranes
- Mobile cranes over 2 tm
- Gantry cranes
- Truck-mounted cranes over 2 tm
- Lift trucks and stackers with permanent driver's seat
- Earth-moving machines over 15 kW (20.4 hp)
- Offshore cranes

For these categories, equipment-specific training must always be given. So make sure you document which brand and model was used in the practical part. This way, you get equipment-specific training documented right away.

## Equipment-specific training
Also called type training or machine-specific training, this is training on the specific machine (brand and model) before use.

It must be documented in writing which equipment (brand and model) training has been given on, who has given the training and who has received it.

## Do you have project-specific equipment?
Kvipp can also be used on project-specific equipment.

## Solve the training easily with Kvipp!
With Kvipp, you get everything in one place: Document both safety training and equipment-specific training efficiently. The system ensures that you always have an overview of who is trained on what, and makes it easy to comply with legal requirements.
