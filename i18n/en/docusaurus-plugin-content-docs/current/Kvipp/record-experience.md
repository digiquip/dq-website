# Record experience

When you use Kvipp, you can also add previous experience. Then you have two options:

*Option 1: Upload previous documentation*

When you are on the website kvipp.it, you can take a picture of or upload previous documentation.

Do you as an employer want control over documentation before you started using Kvipp? Then you can contact us. We don't have any standard solution for this because solutions for documentation without Kvipp vary greatly in quality.

*Option 2: Fill out a self-declaration*

It is possible to add a self-declaration. The self-declaration is a declaration that you have enough experience to reasonably say that you can use the equipment safely. For many, this is a good backup solution when they have long experience but have never received training from anyone that was documented. We emphasize that this is a backup solution and does not meet current formal requirements for documented training. The employer and employee must agree that self-declaration is good enough.

## When can self-declaration be good enough?

Before 2016, there was no requirement for documentation of equipment-specific training. The employer was to provide information, but it wasn't until 2016 that a requirement was added to document "in writing which work equipment training has been given on, who has given the training and who has received training."

If a person has experience with specific work equipment from before 2016, this suggests that self-declaration is good enough. It's not mentioned that the update in 2016 had retroactive effect. However, remember that there was already a requirement to provide necessary training, including information, and to substantiate this, it's always wise to have written documentation.

The self-declaration asks your employees to commit to the following:
"I confirm with this that I have sufficient knowledge of the equipment to operate it safely and/or have access to it. I have acquired knowledge of the equipment through the following (check what applies)

- Previous experience - I have previous experience using this type of machine/equipment
- User manual - I have familiarized myself with the machine's user manual and understand all functions and safety recommendations
- Training video/quick guide - I have reviewed a training video or quick guide that covers the use of the machine

I am aware that I take special responsibility for the use or access to the equipment until my employer has assessed whether my competence is sufficient."
