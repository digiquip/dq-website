# Receive training

Receiving training is easy! Find out who can provide training, and make sure you can identify yourself with an ID card (HSE card, driving licence or passport). Anyone can provide training via Kvipp.

## When do you need training?
- **Equipment that requires special caution**: Training must be documented before use.
- **Similar equipment**: If your employer has defined that training should not be given on similar equipment again, you don't need to complete training again. Check with your employer or in Kvipp what applies where you work.

Before use, it is important to know how the work equipment should be used correctly. This includes:
- Operation
- Safety equipment
- Area of use
- Functionality
- Personal protective equipment, and
- Daily inspection

## What gets documented?
- Training given by
- Training given to
- Date
- Training certificate (PDF)

## After training
- You can find the training certificate in Kvipp and download it if needed. You can also add an email address to receive it by email.
- The employer automatically gets an **overview** in Kvipp Bedrift.
- With K-REG integration activated, certificates are automatically uploaded to Kompetanseregisteret.

## Common questions
- **Do I need an account?** No. Identification is done with HSE card, driving licence or passport.
- **Does the equipment need a QR code?** No. You can take a picture and let artificial intelligence recognize brand and model.
