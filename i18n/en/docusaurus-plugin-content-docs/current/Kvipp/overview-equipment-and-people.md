# Overview equipment and people

With Kvipp, you get an overview!

As people scan their HSE cards and training is conducted, you automatically get an overview. Both people and equipment types are automatically added to the solution.

It is also possible to add both people and equipment types manually.

## What do you get an overview of?
- Equipment types and categories
- Who has training on what
- Training status for specific people and work equipment
- Gap analysis: Who is missing training?
- Documentation!
