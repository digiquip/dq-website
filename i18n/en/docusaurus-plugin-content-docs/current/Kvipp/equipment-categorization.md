# Equipment categorization

Categorization of equipment types is useful for keeping an overview. And even more useful for getting control over training. By categorizing equipment types, you can ensure correct training for the right equipment. And avoid unnecessary training.

Categories are the first step to taking control of training.

## How to get started
Add categories with equipment types that your employees actually use. Remember that you don't need to do categorization often, so the time you spend doing it right the first time will save you time later.

Control question: Does the categorization make sense from a training perspective, is it easy to understand which equipment is covered by each category, and will a new employee quickly understand where a machine belongs?

## Risk assessment and training requirements
Risk assessment and training requirements are done at the category level. Therefore, it is important to categorize related equipment types with similar risks and training requirements. If the category consists of equipment types with great variation in risk and that are very different, you may have categorized too broadly.

For example, it would rarely make sense to create a category called "saw" because this would be open to interpretation. A carpenter would interpret it as handheld circular saw, table saw and miter saw, while a construction worker would think of brush saw and chainsaw.

None of the examples above with saws have the same risk profile or training requirements. After you are satisfied with the categories, the next step is to risk assess and conclude training requirements. See separate chapters for more information on this.
