# Kvipp - as rental company

For equipment that "requires special caution when used", **all employees must have necessary training in the use of the work equipment and only employees who have received training should use it.** This is the employer's responsibility. If someone is to use a tandem roller Volvo DD25B, for example, this is precisely the type of work equipment for which training must be provided (Forskrift om utførelse av arbeid chapter 10). This is called equipment-specific training. Some also call it type training, product- or machine-specific training.

*From Forskrift om utførelse av arbeid.*

Note: Equipment-specific training is in addition to certificates of competence, certifications and courses. See chapters 10 and 11 in Forskrift om utførelse av arbeid for more information.

As a rental provider of machines and equipment, the lessor is responsible for ensuring that the equipment is in proper order, but it is always the employer who has the final responsibility for training.

**Remember** that as a rental provider, you are also an employer for your own employees who use machines and equipment.

## Training as a service
As a rental provider, you can offer equipment-specific training as a service. Giving or receiving training in Kvipp costs nothing and can be performed by anyone at any time. 

PS: Need documentation for billing training? Contact us!

## How to provide training
Go to the website [kvipp.it](https://kvipp.it)

1.Identify yourself and the equipment, and optionally add your own training
2.Choose "provide training". NB: To provide training, you must first register your own training. 
3.Go through a general checklist
4.Add the participants at the end. The participants need HSE card or driving licence/passport to be added to the session. There is no upper limit to how many participants can be added.

## Training others on behalf of our company
With Kvipp Bedrift, you can get a complete overview of who you have provided training to. With the "instructor" role, all training sessions appear in an overview, and it is possible to send documentation afterwards. You assign the role on the page "Authorities".

On the page "Training" you find an overview of training that instructors have provided. The overview includes all people that the instructor has trained, both internal and external. To retrieve who has received training, you can search by participant name and equipment type. Here you also have the option to send documentation (PDF) directly by email.

 ## Multiple equipment in one training session
With the "instructor" role, training can be provided on multiple equipment in the same training session.

- Assign the instructor authority in Kvipp Bedrift. You do this on the page called permissions.
- The person providing training chooses to provide training on behalf of the company and thus gets the opportunity to add more equipment.
- In the training session, the instructor goes through the checklist once. This means that if some of the checkpoints vary, the equipment is not suitable to be part of the same session.

## How the customer finds completed training
All training is automatically registered on the person. There are several ways to find completed training and training certificates (PDF). Here is some information you can share with the customer:

- **Training certificates per email**

Go to kvipp.it and identify yourself. Then go to the dropdown menu at the top and add email address. Choose to receive all training certificates by email.

- **Download**

You can also find training status in Kvipp, and from there download training certificates. Identify both person and equipment to get latest status and document.
