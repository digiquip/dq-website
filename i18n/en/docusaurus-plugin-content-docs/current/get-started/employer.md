# Kvipp - as employer

# Background: Requirements for documentation and training

For work equipment that requires special caution when used, all employees must have necessary training in the use of the work equipment and only employees who have received training should use it (see "Forskrift om utførelse av arbeid" chapters 10 and 11).

The employer must assess whether the work equipment requires special caution when used, and what kind of training is necessary. For categorizations with equipment that can be dangerous, the starting point is that everyone should have training before use for each specific model and brand. Exception: For work equipment that is similar, it is nevertheless not necessary with new training per brand and model. **This assessment must be documented and shared with the employees.**

The employer has a duty to provide training in everything related to the employee's work. In "Arbeidsmiljøloven" § 3-2, you can read more about the obligation to provide:
Point 1: Necessary training
Point 2: Personal protective equipment and training in use
Point 3: Possible preparation of written instructions
More about training before use of work equipment is further described in Forskrift om utførelse av arbeid chapters 10 and 11.

## Training as main rule

- Large machines should always have equipment-specific training. If use requires a certificate, you must have equipment-specific training before using the machine.
If you are to use a tandem roller of the type Volvo DD25B, it is exactly that type you should get training on before use. You do the training in Kvipp.
- For smaller equipment (e.g. handheld), it may be sufficient to receive equipment-specific training on one type within the category, provided that the types are similar AND that you have documented this assessment. This means that you must document that the types have similar operation, construction and so on. You do this assessment easily in Kvipp Bedrift.

Equipment-specific training is in addition to certificates of competence, certifications and courses.

## Rolling out Kvipp
With Kvipp, you have a tool to implement and document equipment-specific training. The training requirement may be unknown among employees, so we always recommend a review of what equipment-specific training is and how it should be addressed with Kvipp.

## How to do it

- Go to the website [kvipp.it](https://kvipp.it) 
- Who will use the equipment? Identify person with HSE card or other ID, such as driving licence or passport.
HSE card: Choose QR and scan the QR code on the HSE card.
Driving licence or passport: Choose image and let artificial intelligence find first name, surname and date of birth.

With HSE card, all training is automatically saved on the company. If you don't have HSE cards, employees can be added manually in Kvipp Bedrift. When driving licence or passport is recognised, it is important that the persons check that first name, surname and date of birth are correct so that the information is correct and can be searched later.
- Which equipment? Identify the equipment to be used:
Image: Use artificial intelligence to recognise brand and type. The serial number plate often has the correct information.
QR: If the equipment has a QR code from DigiQuip or Reginn, you can scan this QR code and get brand and type.
Search: With the Equipment Owner role, which is given under authorities in Kvipp Bedrift, you can search and create equipment. You get a new option called "search". Then follow the wizard.


## Registration of equipment-specific training
When you are about to start equipment-specific training, you can either receive training from someone else or complete a self-declaration. If you already have documentation, you can upload it.

    style={{ width: '100%', height: '100%' }}
  ></iframe>
</div>

## How to provide training
To provide training, you must first register your own training. Then you get the option "provide training". Follow these steps:

1.Identify yourself and the equipment, and optionally add your own training
2.Choose "provide training"
3.Go through a general checklist
4.Add the participants at the end. The participants need HSE card or driving licence/passport to be added to the session. There is no upper limit to how many participants can be added.

## How to find completed training
There are several ways to find completed training and training certificates (PDF).

- **Training certificates per email**

Go to kvipp.it and identify yourself. Then go to the dropdown menu at the top and add email address. Choose to receive all training certificates by email.

import epost from '/img/kvipp-docs-people/epost.jpg';

<br/>

- **Download**

You can also find training status in Kvipp, and from there download training certificates. Identify both person and equipment to get latest status and document.

- **Kvipp Bedrift subscription**

In Kvipp Bedrift, all training is updated in real time. As a manager, you can easily find out what training your people have, who can use which equipment and not least group equipment and people to get an overview of any gaps and progress.

Kvipp Bedrift costs 490 kroner per month for small companies (up to 10 employees) and 1390 kroner per month for others.

- **K-REG (& HMSREG)**

Training data and documents can be uploaded directly to K-REG. The K-REG integration can either be purchased standalone for 990 kr per month or as an add-on to Kvipp Bedrift for 500 kr per month. For small companies, the K-REG integration is included.

PS: You don't need a subscription in K-REG for the information to be uploaded there, but you must have a subscription if you are to see the training there. All training that is added to K-REG also becomes available in HMSREG. Contact Sentralregisteret for more information about this.

## Grouping equipment and/or persons
Groups are designed to simplify the work of ensuring that people have necessary training. Perhaps you want to group by profession, to plan when hiring new people or as a temporary project, then you can test out groups for this.

In addition, you can print a QR code for the group. When you scan that QR code, all the equipment appears. This gives you a shortcut to start training on many pieces of equipment simultaneously.

## What is the "instructor" role?

With the instructor role, the person providing training gets more options: 
- Can provide training on multiple equipment in the same session.
- Can provide training on behalf of the company. On the training certificate it will state that training is given on behalf of the company.
- Automatic upload to K-REG*
- Overview of completed training.

The role is assigned on the page called authorities.

*If the integration is activated. Contact us to activate.

With the "instructor" role, all training sessions appear in an overview. The overview includes all people that the instructor has trained - both internal and external. To retrieve who has received training, you can search by participant name and equipment type. Here you also have the option to send documentation (PDF) directly by email.
