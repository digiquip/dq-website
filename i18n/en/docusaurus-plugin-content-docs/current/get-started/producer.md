# Kvipp - as supplier

When you as a supplier of machines and equipment provide equipment-specific training, you can document it in Kvipp. With Kvipp, the equipment-specific training is automatically stored digitally, and the customer gets all the overview on an ongoing basis. Giving and receiving training in Kvipp costs nothing.

## What is equipment-specific training?
For equipment that "requires special caution when used", **all employees must have necessary training in the use of the work equipment and only employees who have received training should use it.** This is the employer's responsibility. If an employee is to use a tandem roller Volvo DD25B, for example, this is precisely the type of work equipment for which training must be provided (Forskrift om utførelse av arbeid chapter 10). This is called equipment-specific training in professional language. Some also call it type training, product- or machine-specific training.

*From Forskrift om utførelse av arbeid.*

Note: Equipment-specific training is in addition to certificates of competence, certifications and courses.

## How to provide training
Go to the website [kvipp.it](https://kvipp.it)

1.Identify yourself and the equipment, and optionally add your own training
2.Choose "provide training". NB: To provide training, you must first register your own training. 
3.Go through a general checklist
4.Add the participants at the end. The participants need HSE card or driving licence/passport to be added to the session. There is no upper limit to how many participants can be added.

## Training on behalf of the company

With the instructor role, the person providing training gets more options:
- Can provide training on multiple equipment in the same session.
- Can provide training on behalf of the company. On the training certificate it will state that training is given on behalf of the company.

The role is assigned in Kvipp Bedrift on the Authorities page.

**One of the main advantages of being an instructor is that all training is stored in a separate overview in Kvipp Bedrift.** The overview includes all people that the instructor has trained - both internal and external. To retrieve who has received training, you can search by participant name and equipment type. **Here you also have the option to send documentation (PDF) directly by email.**

All training is automatically registered on the person. There are several ways to find completed training and training certificates (PDF). Here is some information you can share with the customer:

- **Training certificates per email**
